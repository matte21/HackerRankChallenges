# HackerRank challenges
This repo contains solutions to the challenges on HackerRank I am taking for fun and to prepare for interviews. Roughly one challenge a day will be added.


Each challenge has a root folder named after itself. Each of such folders contains the solution under `pkg/solution/<problem_name>.go`. For instance, the solution to the problem with name [SockMerchant](SockMerchant) is located under
[`SockMerchant/pkg/solution/sockmerchant.go`](SockMerchant/pkg/solution/sockmerchant.go). Under the root dir of each challenge there's a README.md with the challenge statement.

All solutions are in Go.
In the files containing the solutions there are comments stating time and
space complexity.

## Solved challenges:
* Easy
  * [SockMerchant](SockMerchant)
  * [CountingValleys](CountValleys)
  * [JumpingOnClouds](JumpingOnClouds)
* Medium
* Hard
