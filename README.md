# HackerRank challenges

This repo contains solutions to the challenges on HackerRank I am taking for fun
and to prepare for interviews. Roughly one challenge a day will be added.

Solutions are stored under [solutions/](solutions/). Each challenge has a root folder named
after itself. Each of such folders contains the solution in
`pkg/solution/<problem_name>.go`. For instance, the solution to the problem with
name [SockMerchant](solutions/SockMerchant) is located under
[`solutions/SockMerchant/pkg/solution/sockmerchant.go`](solutions/SockMerchant/pkg/solution/sockmerchant.go).
Under the root dir of each challenge there's a README with a link to the
challenge statement and other information.

All solutions are in Go.
In the files containing the solutions there are comments stating time and
space complexity.

## Support utils

This repo dir structure is quite regular, which makes it easy to automate some
tasks with scripts. [utils](utils) contains the scripts I use to
automate such tasks.
